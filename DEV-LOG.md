# NADI development log

Append-only milestone history, established 2026-10-10. Earlier events below are
retrospective entries citing their original reports; unknown outcomes remain UNKNOWN.
Append a correction/superseding event rather than changing an earlier result.

IMPLEMENTED = artifact exists at named revision; TESTED = specified checks ran;
MERGED = GitHub integration verified; VISIBLE = observed in named runtime;
ACCEPTED = named authority accepted a stated scope. These milestones are independent.
CI PASS alone does not prove runtime visibility, PO acceptance or operational UAT.
A developer acceptance report is not a Product Owner signature.

- **Task ID:** NADI-DOC-FOUNDATION-01.
- **Objective:** Establish permanent product context, requirements, design specifications and development governance without runtime changes.
- **Branch:** codex/nadi-doc-foundation-01, separate documentation worktree.
- **Commit SHA:** `80bd3cb7e5aa2d4c1f817cb00b1bf39be0ebf7b4` implements the documentation foundation; this appended delivery record follows it. Base main: `f54643f3510bf505628a1400024784faab46e496`.
- **PR:** [#64](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/64).
- **Implementation Status:** IMPLEMENTED — 14 Markdown files; context, PRD, design system, 11 page specs, reference manifest, authority/audit, UX track and onboarding. No application implementation.
- **Test Status:** TESTED — relative links/page-section completeness, historical-content and AGENTS preservation, Markdown diff checks PASS; all 18 baseline NADI/fixture container IDs/start times, development PIDs/status and XLS hash retained. No new runtime/browser/DB mutation tests.
- **CI Status:** PENDING at this checkpoint; explicit existing source-free GitHub workflow dispatch follows the final documentation commit. Exact head/result remains visible in PR64 checks; prior main/PR62/PR63 SUCCESS is separate evidence.
- **Merge Status:** OPEN / UNMERGED; no automatic merge.
- **Development Visibility:** Documents visible on PR64; documentation branch is not the running frontend. HTTPS3000 remains clean PR62 head `0bfea1273f97ce96a08ef147b44f804aecb428d1` with factual and isolated QA backends AVAILABLE.
- **Product Owner Acceptance:** PENDING — no new PO visual sign-off or actual engineer UAT claimed.
- **Remaining Blockers:** Three original screenshots missing; detailed design/token/navigation acceptance; PR63 engineer validation; operational activation gates; Phase1 review outcomes UNKNOWN. Task continuation after truncated section12 unavailable.
- **Next Action:** Review PR64 and exact-head CI; obtain original reference files and record approvals; reconcile PR62/63 when separately authorized, following the preservation plan.

Evidence: [foundation audit and reconciliation](docs/NADI-DOC-FOUNDATION-01.md),
[reference manifest](docs/design/references/README.md),
[official roadmap](plans/NADI-ROADMAP.md). This is documentation delivery, not
completion of UX-02–09 implementation or operational deployment.

- **PR:** [#64](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/64), same PR.
- **Implementation Status:** IMPLEMENTED documentation correction; all five reference mappings AVAILABLE, no image bytes changed or added.
- **Test Status:** Five visual mappings, PNG signatures/chunk CRCs/decompression, dimensions, byte sizes and SHA256 verified against tracked main; documentation link/diff checks recorded in PR64 handoff.
- **CI Status:** Previous exact-head run38006800506 SUCCESS; FIX-02 exact-head workflow is dispatched after push and linked in PR64 (workflow_dispatch may leave PR check rollup empty).
- **Merge Status:** PR64 OPEN / UNMERGED; PR62/63 independently rechecked OPEN at unchanged heads.
- **Development Visibility:** Documentation update only; no application/browser or runtime acceptance claimed or changed.
- **Product Owner Acceptance:** Explicit FIX-02 approval of existing PNG references and mapping; not acceptance of implemented UI, engineering semantics or UAT.
- **Remaining Blockers:** No image/ZIP blocker remains. Token/contrast review, implemented UI visual acceptance, engineer-validation and operational gates remain.
- **Next Action:** Review updated PR64 and exact-head CI; use existing PNG links for later UI tasks; no automatic merge.

Evidence: [official reference manifest](docs/design/references/README.md),
[page specifications](docs/design/NADI-UI-SPEC.md). The earlier missing-JPG and
FIX-01 ZIP requirement is superseded by the Product Owner's explicit FIX-02
instruction; earlier log checkpoints remain unchanged.

- **PR:** [#64](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/64).
- **Implementation Status:** Documentation reconciliation in three actual conflicting roadmap/status files, with current onboarding/PRD references updated. Main's application/runtime bytes preserved.
- **Test Status:** Conflict-marker, diff, relative-link, PNG integrity/provenance, eleven-page and phase/UX/PdM continuity checks in the PR handoff.
- **CI Status:** New exact-HEAD backend/frontend CI follows push; run/results linked in PR64. Prior runs remain historical.
- **Merge Status:** PR62/63 MERGED; main merged into PR64 branch; PR64 stays OPEN pending review.
- **Development Visibility:** No runtime source switch, configuration change, restart or database action.
- **Product Owner Acceptance:** Reconciliation authorized by FIX-03; no new UI/UAT or operational acceptance inferred.
- **Remaining Blockers:** PR64 review and CI/mergeability verification; existing engineering/visual activation gates unchanged.
- **Next Action:** Review exact-HEAD CI and mergeability; no automatic merge of PR64.

## 2026-10-11 — NADI-ENG-BUNDLE-A delivery / autonomous review

Date: 2026-10-11 (Asia/Jakarta)
Task ID: NADI-ENG-BUNDLE-A
Objective: structured Engineering Cases and governed QA advisory recipient experience.
Branch: codex/nadi-eng-bundle-a
Commit SHA: implementation `2a7678d82f6f0e8769a03ca09857c59f2f37f338`; delivery docs may advance PR HEAD.
PR: [#68](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/68)
Implementation Status: IMPLEMENTED — ENG-UX-01/02, ADV-01/02/03; ADV-04 PLANNED.
Test Status: TESTED — 161 disposable PostgreSQL backend/HTTPS tests, zero skips; frontend assertions, TypeScript/lint/build; 31 Engineering + 102 Bundle A + 129 Bundle B browser checks. Initial SQLite 97 pass/58 skip is distinct. Advisory browser fixtures are DEMO; durable backend acceptance is disposable-only.
CI Status: backend/frontend PASS on exact implementation `2a7678d82f6f0e8769a03ca09857c59f2f37f338` ([run](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/actions/runs/38072796251)); final delivery-document PR exact-head status verified independently at handoff.
Merge Status: NOT MERGED; PR #67 remains independent OPEN.
Development Visibility: VISIBLE Case/Recommendation/Action Board QA on HTTPS 3000. Advisory persistence/inbox BLOCKED_SCHEMA_PREREQUISITE in unchanged persistent QA store. New APIs and controls fail closed; fixture screenshots are not runtime persistence proof.
Product Owner Acceptance: PENDING; engineer UAT/operational distribution PENDING.
Remaining Blockers: automatic approval review denied persistent QA constraint expansion; organizational recipient identity and real distribution remain future gated.
Next Action: explicit authorization decision for the existing QA constraint, followed by persistent advisory publication/receipt UAT; no operational activation.
Evidence: [implementation/self-review](reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-eng-bundle-a.md), [responsive evidence](reliability-cockpit/docs/evidence/nadi-eng-bundle-a/README.md). Official backup and rollback to `8658c2fbd00bb78f1d8ee2b4462ccece4200a30e` verified. All 35 original container IDs/start times, 481 non-account rows, 39 original sessions, three account grants/credentials, workbook and PNG hashes preserved; normal login timestamp changes are documented.

Merge Status: NOT MERGED; PR #67 independently OPEN and unchanged.
Development Visibility: VISIBLE at HTTPS3000, clean source/backend/launch01434fb; affected QA API only reloaded, original frontend process preserved. Advisory/inbox capability READY; actual publication/ACK retained after reload/reconnect and deliberate withdrawal.
Product Owner Acceptance: limited conditional schema/execution authority given by PO; Persistent QA Acceptance execution PASS. Actual engineer UAT, PO visual review and operational/production acceptance PENDING.
Remaining Blockers: no persistent-QA schema blocker remains. Organizational recipients/identity, real channels/custody/UAT and operational rollout still separately gated.
Next Action: senior/PO review of unmerged PR #68 and QA evidence; retain expanded CHECK and all records on application rollback. No merge or operational activation without further approval.
Evidence: [FIX-01 report](reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-eng-bundle-a-fix-01.md), [actual persistent evidence](reliability-cockpit/docs/evidence/nadi-eng-bundle-a-fix-01/README.md).

CI Status: local PASS; exact release backend/frontend CI independently verified at new PR HEAD after push.
Merge Status: NOT MERGED; neither PR67 nor PR68 merged.
Development Visibility: VISIBLE on soleHTTPS3000 via official launcher. Final source/backend/launch SHA independently checked after release selection; pre-cutover Secure session survives actual rollback and original3QA records remain exact.
Product Owner Acceptance: QA integration/testing authorization; final visual, senior review and real engineer UAT PENDING. Self-review is not Product Owner acceptance.
Remaining Blockers: no QA schema prerequisite; operational identity/recipients/channels/UAT still gated; Phase1 review/checkpoint/expiry remain independent unchanged.
Next Action: senior/PO review integration PR and exact-head CI; no automatic merge or global authentication/Phase3 activation.
Evidence: [integration/self-review](reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-eng-integration-01.md), [fresh screenshots/results](reliability-cockpit/docs/evidence/nadi-eng-integration-01/README.md).

CI Status: exact-head backend/frontend termasuk PostgreSQL acceptance dan fixture browser diverifikasi setelah push pada PR handoff; tidak diartikan sebagai runtime deployment.
Merge Status: NOT MERGED.
Development Visibility: kandidat belum dipilih; HTTPS 3000 existing tetap bersih di b348235ce6f82c84873a65344ad2ef5fe276987d. Screenshot kandidat adalah QA SINTETIS network-isolated, bukan deployment atau persistence acceptance baru.
Product Owner Acceptance: arah bahasa disetujui dalam task; final wording/visual/senior review dan engineer UAT PENDING.
Remaining Blockers: official launcher switch memerlukan penghentian web+QA API; task ini melarang perubahan layanan/data/deployment QA. Definisi metode/threshold dan operational identity/channel/UAT tetap gated; Phase 1 deadlines unchanged.
