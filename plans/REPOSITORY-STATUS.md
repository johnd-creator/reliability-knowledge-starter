# Repository status and debt — PLATFORM-ROADMAP-001

## Current development checkpoint — NADI UX Bundle B — 2026-10-10

Verified main: **160737b3bfaeac94f4e8093b8566ca0e5d3585c9**; PR65 MERGED.
`codex/nadi-ux-bundle-b` implements UX-05/06/07 on the existing V1 shell. Asset
Register/detail/assessment routes retain factual contracts. PdM, Recommendations
and Action Board use only the authenticated development QA read contracts and
explicit SYNTHETIC labels; operational activation and engineer UAT remain pending.
[Implementation/self-review evidence](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-ux-bundle-b.md)
records exact functional source, visual evidence, regressions, corrections and
launcher rollback. Final HEAD/CI and serving SHA are independently verified in the
PR/task handoff. UX-08/09 remain PLANNED; no global enforcement or operational policy
change. PR63 Q01–Q10 and original Phase1 reviews/expiry remain intact.

## Historical Bundle A delivery checkpoint — 2026-10-10

Verified main: **963e7a8bf0b2a7cf62b1ee8a5661c95d62df7108**; PR62/63/64 MERGED.
The integrated branch `codex/nadi-ux-bundle-a` implements UX-02/03/04 and bounded
self-review. Development preview is selected explicitly through the same launcher
at https://localhost:3000. [Implementation/review evidence](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-ux-bundle-a.md)
records source selection, tests, screenshots and rollback. Merge and final Product
Owner visual acceptance remain separate pending gates. UX-05–09 stay PLANNED.
No operational source/data/collector or Phase1 policy changes are introduced.
Phase1 operator-review evidence remains UNKNOWN; existing deadlines still apply.

## Historical audit — NADI-DOC-FOUNDATION-FIX-03 — 2026-10-10

Latest fetched `origin/main`: **0cb26882c870185a54282df3af4a136f31702b67**. PR29–63 are MERGED.
PR64 remains OPEN on codex/nadi-doc-foundation-01. FIX-03 merges latest main into
this clean documentation worktree; no active development worktree is switched.

| Merged work | Merge commit | Preserved authority |
|---|---|---|
| [PR62](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/62) | `72b7ec55acbb3d5d9562102c3eaf721d4dda714b` | [Persistent single HTTPS3000 frontend/runbook](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-dev-reset-01.md) |
| [PR63](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/63) | `0cb26882c870185a54282df3af4a136f31702b67` | [PdM R01–R08, Q01–Q10 and M01–M07](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-pdm-requirements-01.md) |

Prior source-head CI results remain historical: main/PR61 run37921470470,
PR62 run37940329956, PR63 run37932325576. FIX-03 CI must match the new PR64 HEAD;
its result is linked in the PR handoff. [Foundation audit](../docs/NADI-DOC-FOUNDATION-01.md)
retains earlier inventories and the superseding conflict-resolution checkpoint.

PR63's phase summary and measurement/investigation backlog are preserved in the
[official roadmap](NADI-ROADMAP.md) and owning packet rather than duplicated here.
Historical acceptance reports, manual-PdM clarifications and Phase3 addendum remain
unchanged from latest main. No runtime/collector/database action is performed.

Current phase status belongs to [the official roadmap](NADI-ROADMAP.md);
requirements/design to [PRD](../PRD.md)/[UI spec](../docs/design/NADI-UI-SPEC.md);
independent milestone history to [DEV-LOG](../DEV-LOG.md). Development acceptance
is not actual engineer UAT or operational activation. FIX-02 verifies the five existing root PNGs as
[official references](../docs/design/references/README.md); no additional images
are required. Outstanding: PO implementation visual/token/navigation review, PR63 Q01–Q10, operational application
provisioning/storage/security/UAT, and UNKNOWN Phase1 operator-review outcomes.
The original Phase1 expiry and accepted factual evidence remain unchanged.

### Historical status records

The dated records below are preserved in full. Use their original scope/date;
older “current”/“next” statements are not the latest task sequence.

## NADI-E-INTEGRATION-02 — local authentication and final audit — 2026-10-09

Main `eda3595a9b8d86726dd0d89192ebf4657b66d27e` unchanged. Bundle E PR51–59 preserved;
E9 PR60 and E10 PR61 extend the OPEN/UNMERGED stack. Local username/password is the
selected initial-QA identity path; enterprise SSO is optional future work.
Tested implementation `1ec149de2d1acd4113987364e1f96c790bfaf63e`.
Argon2id accounts, private operator admin, versioned sessions/RBAC, actual HTTPS
login/workflow and disposable migration006 validated. Audit LOW stale-response
finding repaired; Compose preflight argv and migration docs corrected.
Cockpit687/Maximo181/PI191/contracts14 PASS,0FAIL/0SKIP including11 Timescale;
frontend143/browser40 +legacy25/type/build/32-file safety PASS. Actual source-free
preflight remains NO_GO with unapproved host/policy/storage references.
**Development acceptance PASS; merge READY pending explicit authorization/exact-head CI.**
**Phase1 CURRENT/PARTIAL; Phase2 CANDIDATE/PARTIAL; real QA NO_GO; activation OFF.**
Actual host/TLS, application DB/roles, admin custody/onboarding, reviewed startup and
secure frontend transport, password/session/resource policy, storage/scanner,
PdM fields/UAT and per-action deployment authority remain required. No SSO gate.
No production source GET/write, WO mutation, DB DDL, deployment or Phase1 mutation.
Older test counts/checkpoints below are historical.
[Final audit, tests, activation blockers and merge plan](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-e-integration-02.md).

## Bundle D merged / Bundle E QA preparation — 2026-10-09

PR44–50 MERGED via merge commits; authoritative main
eda3595a9b8d86726dd0d89192ebf4657b66d27e. Older OPEN/candidate statements below
are historical. Bundle E stack51→59 is OPEN/UNMERGED, preparation only.
Dedicated QA architecture, enterprise trust contracts, fail-closed privilege
audit, attachment integrity/recovery, bounded HTTP, source-free preflight, exact
artifact binding and disposable restart/restore rehearsal validated.
Final Cockpit661/Maximo181/PI191/contracts14,11Timescale, frontend127/type/build/
safety and browser25 PASS. No real QA UAT or operational activation.
**Phase1 CURRENT/PARTIAL; Phase2 QA preparation CANDIDATE/PARTIAL; real QA NO-GO.**
Operator allowed naming; actual host/IdP/DB role provisioning/storage/scanner,
reviewed real-QA startup/frontend integration, PdM fields/UAT and explicit
deployment authority remain required. No new production source request/write,
WO changes, DB DDL, deployment or Phase1 mutation.
[Bundle E handoff](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-phase2-bundle-e.md).


## Bundle D final integration review — NADI-D-INTEGRATION-01

Baseline main e836710 unchanged. Stack44→50 remains OPEN; no merge/deployment.
Session cancellation finding corrected6f66ecd in PR48; normal forward merges
preserve ancestry. Final implementation c03e57c; final documents at PR50 head.
Local acceptance Cockpit610/Maximo181/PI191/contracts14,11Timescale, HTTP11,
browser25 +proxy8, frontend110/type/build/safety PASS. Corrected scoped CI run
37892980855 SUCCESS; final PR50 CI must match its exact head before merge.
**Merge candidate READY pending explicit operator authorization.**
**Phase1 CURRENT/PARTIAL; Phase2 QA CANDIDATE/PARTIAL; operational activation BLOCKED.**
PUBLIC/default/schema-owner privilege audit, enterprise identity/deadlines,
attachment storage/recovery/scanner, PdM field approval and operational UAT remain
activation gates. QA proxy streaming caps are a non-operational follow-up.
[Final review, findings and controlled merge plan](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-d-integration-01.md). Older checkpoints
retain historical evidence; no source/production/Phase1 mutation or new acquisition.

## Current development checkpoint — Phase 2 Bundle D

Baseline main `e836710d1984af7a4bfb739bad0bfbbb96d544ca`, Bundle C PR37–43 MERGED.
Tested implementation `ee20307a2664e7ca64737c3f43f1256f26cdf9f6`.
**Development/test acceptance PASS; operational activation BLOCKED.**
**Phase1 CURRENT/PARTIAL; Phase2 integrated QA CANDIDATE/PARTIAL.**
D1–D7 stack adds enterprise identity adapter/session bootstrap, deliberate
application migration ledger/writer grants, private attachment service and real
HTTP/PostgreSQL/frontend workflow. Operational Engineering routes remain unmounted.
No production/source/Phase1 mutation; Maximo/PI strictly READ-ONLY, NADI never
creates or changes Maximo WO. Original accepted runtime is unchanged.

Final local Cockpit600, Maximo181, PI191, contracts14 PASS;11 formerly skipped
Timescale tests now executed in disposable fixtures. HTTP11/browser25/frontend110,
29 safety files/typecheck/build/diff-check PASS. D6 actual GitHub backend/frontend
jobs SUCCESS, run37887690942. Security diff review found no concrete reportable
issue in15 changed source/config surfaces; production IdP/storage not certified.
Real enterprise IdP/directory, existing-store provisioning/privilege approval,
secure storage/scanning, PdM engineer field sign-off and operational UI/UAT remain
external activation gates. QA command editor is not final engineering form UX.
[Bundle D acceptance and activation manifest](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-phase2-bundle-d.md) records the exact stack,
recovery proposal, test evidence and limits. Next: senior stack review, then
separately authorized identity/provisioning/field UAT. Older checkpoints below
retain historical measured evidence; they are not re-certified by this bundle.

## Current development checkpoint — Phase 2 Bundle C

Verified main `7a846ef2c7e25306f23da99dd011e1d54aa8f4a4`, BundleB PR30–36 MERGED.
**Phase1 CURRENT/PARTIAL; Phase2 CANDIDATE/PARTIAL; operational activation OFF.**
Stacked C1–C7 candidates add same-asset local context/maintenance chronology,
reviewed manual inspection evidence, case-linked recommendations and independent
local completion verification, integrated development-only concept screens and
trusted-session/PostgreSQL acceptance. Maximo/PI remain strictly source READ-ONLY;
NADI recommendations never create/update/close/approve/cancel Maximo WOs.

Local validation: Cockpit532 PASS (all disposable PG/Compose), Maximo181 PASS,
contracts14 PASS/35schemas, PI180 PASS/11 isolated Timescale SKIP;100 frontend
assertions,27 safety files,40 browser assertions, TypeScript/build/diff-check PASS.
No production access, DB/DDL, deployment, source acquisition or Phase1 mutation.
Enterprise identity/bootstrap, deliberate application provisioning/migration ledger,
PdM engineer fields, secure storage and operational UI integration/UAT remain BLOCKED.
Candidate UI is browser-memory DEMO only; no operational writer route is mounted.
Do not mark Phase1 or Phase2 COMPLETE. Historical operational evidence, GOV03 policy
approvals/checkpoints/expiry and accepted condition evidence are unchanged and not
re-certified by this software task.
[Bundle C report, stack and handoff](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-phase2-bundle-c.md)
Next: trusted enterprise bootstrap/provisioning contracts → engineer field approval
→ operational UAT. New Maximo coverage requires separate collection authorization.


## Current development checkpoint — Phase 2 Bundle B

Main `02e887c56057611f112b7b652ba9a9aee8b382ea`, corrected PR29 MERGED.
**Phase 1 CURRENT/PARTIAL; Phase 2 CANDIDATE/PARTIAL; activation OFF.**
B1–B7 implement source-boundary policy/coverage, trusted identity/session adapters,
bounded local WO context, Manual PdM envelope, NADI-native recommendations,
development-only concept lab and isolated integrated acceptance. Maximo/PI remain
strictly source read-only. A recommendation is not a WO or maintenance authorization.
No production source GET, DB/DDL, deployment, activation or Phase-1 evidence mutation.

Local evidence: Cockpit 462 pass (isolated PG + Compose), Maximo 181 pass,
contracts 14 pass, PI 180 pass/11 fixture skips; frontend 25+37 assertions,
product safety/typecheck/build and 24 browser checks pass. Enterprise provider,
reviewed session bootstrap/provisioning/migration ledger, engineer-approved method
fields, directories and operational UI/UAT remain required. No phase is marked COMPLETE.
[Bundle report and review stack](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-phase2-bundle-b.md) records limitations and migration/rollback proposals.
Next: trusted enterprise identity + PdM field sign-off + reviewed application
provisioning/backend integration. Earlier runtime checkpoints below are historical;
GOV03 approvals/checkpoints/expiry are unchanged and are not re-certified here.


## Current development checkpoint — overnight Engineering bundle 01

Baseline PR28 MERGED, main `e67c641e23214bf8851a05d312e1426c1e471ec3`.
**Phase 1 CURRENT/PARTIAL; Phase 2 IN DEVELOPMENT; Phase 3 DESIGN READY.**
Source-free candidate adds typed human cases, attributed independent review,
transactional audit/idempotency/concurrency, bounded local canonical references,
disabled isolated API contracts and an explicitly synthetic development-only UI.
Production write routes remain unmounted: trusted application identity/RBAC/session
and application writer/migration provisioning are BLOCKED, not simulated as users.
RCFA identity/Data Trust provider and operational UAT remain explicit gaps.

[Morning acceptance](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-phase2-overnight-bundle-01.md)
and [Phase 3 design](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-phase3-diagnostic-foundation.md)
record exact available tests and readiness. No source request, operational DB write,
deployment, worker/env/grant change or new operational database. Accepted R3 evidence,
GOV-03 policies/checkpoints/expiry and Phase-1 semantics remain untouched. This
checkpoint authorizes development reporting only; historical runtime evidence below
is not replaced by a new observation. Next: **NADI-PH2-02 — Trusted Engineering
Identity & Activation Contracts**. Do not mark Phase 2 COMPLETE or diagnostics live.

## Current runtime checkpoint — NADI-P1-FRESH-GOV-03 (8 October 2026)

**PASS — temporary internal monitoring ACTIVE; Phase 1 CURRENT/PARTIAL.**
Fauzi authorized MAXIMO_WO=660s, MART_FACTUAL=660s, PI_COLLECTOR=1800s as
project owner/accountable internal technical approver. External endorsements are
not required or claimed. Legacy and both condition policy settings remain UNSET.
Original 8 October owner approval stays DATE_ONLY; historical GOV02 is preserved.

Actual activation `2026-10-08T21:45:26.619585+07:00`; 24h review
`2026-10-09T21:45:26.619585+07:00`; 72h review `2026-10-11T21:45:26.619585+07:00`.
Explicit owner-revised hard expiry **2026-10-13T00:00:00+07:00**.
Fauzi confirms **12 October 20:00 WIB** checkpoint and rollback before expiry
without an approved extension. Enforcement is manual; no automatic scheduler.

Main `1f7c25a711e68afc87ee0c4b1322bfca4be6ba97` / PR27 MERGED; actual serving SHA `1cf7fed971594581913e8e7f635691f834133b6e`,
application source identical to main. Same-image API replacement only; other 22
containers preserved. R3 evidence/timestamps, VERIFIED1/PROPOSED0, approved signal1,
latest/state1/1 and 433 active technical attributes unchanged; source GET0.
Initial readiness **8 PASS / 1 UNKNOWN**. Final observation **7 PASS / 1 PARTIAL /
1 UNKNOWN**, overall UNKNOWN, require-pass exit2: unchanged background PI worker
completed 432/433 with 1 error; prior full-cycle success is preserved. No retry/probe.
Condition freshness acceptance remains outstanding; technical BAD_QUALITY18/epoch
anomalies remain visible and are independent of collection freshness.

[Activation and rollback evidence](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-p1-fresh-gov-03.md)
and [migration handoff](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-pre-migration-readiness-gov-03.md)
record remaining operator reviews, manual expiry risk and separately authorized
future cutover. No server migration, condition refresh/replay, DDL or approval changes.
Earlier sections below are historical and do not override this checkpoint.

Public SEC01 audit preserves approval scope, dates, thresholds and recorded readiness;
host-specific deployment and executable recovery details are retained privately.
Sanitization changes documentation only; runtime and accepted evidence are unchanged.
Git history is retained, so earlier public revisions remain accessible.

## Historical owner decision — NADI-P1-FRESH-GOV-02 (8 October 2026)

**PROJECT_OWNER_APPROVED**: Fauzi approved MAXIMO_WO=660s, MART_FACTUAL=660s,
PI_COLLECTOR=1800s for provisional monitoring; both condition policies stay UNSET.
This is conversational authorization reported directly in the user-supplied task,
not digitally signed or externally authenticated approval. Three component
endorsements remain PENDING; **ACTIVATION_NOT_AUTHORIZED / GOV-03 NOT EXECUTED**.

[Approval register and handoff](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-p1-fresh-gov-02.md)
preserve the historical proposal, named reviewer gaps, date-only approval precision
and expiry rule. Calendar expiry reference is 15 October 2026; exact expiry instant
is NULL until approval-time/timezone evidence or explicit expiry clarification.
Activation, 24h/72h review dates remain NULL. No duplicate owner approval requested.

All eight runtime policies remain UNSET; R3 evidence/journal preserved. Actual
readiness 5 PASS / 4 UNKNOWN; hypothetical 8 PASS / 1 UNKNOWN; overall UNKNOWN. Phase1
CURRENT/PARTIAL, not COMPLETE. Next: component endorsements, exact expiry
resolution, reviewed release and separately authorized controlled GOV-03 activation.
No source GET, policy change, operational mutation or deployment occurred.

## Historical decision package — NADI-P1-FRESH-GOV-01 (8 October 2026)

**PASS: ready for owner review. Policies are not activated; approvals PENDING.**
Reviewed/serving release `1cf7fed971594581913e8e7f635691f834133b6e` includes PR26.
Accepted R3 real Coal Flow A evidence 54.84218978881836 Ton/h, original source/
collection/projection times and strict replay are preserved. VERIFIED=1 / PROPOSED=0,
approved signal=1, latest/state=1/1; all eight freshness settings remain UNSET.

[Engineering decision package](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-p1-fresh-gov-01.md)
evaluates nearly 24h of local evidence: 278 WO attempts / 273 successes; 287 paired Mart
completion reports; 104 PI runs / 99 full 433/433 successes. Proposes 660/660/1800 seconds for
**provisional monitoring pending named owner/reviewer approval**, with proposed
7-day expiry. Condition source/projection remain DEFERRED: two manual samples
cannot establish cadence or acceptable use-age. No source GET/acquisition/replay,
production mutation, activation or restart occurred.

Source-free fourteen-case simulation passes; targeted 45 tests PASS / 9 PostgreSQL skips.
Actual readiness remains 5 PASS / 4 UNKNOWN, overall UNKNOWN. Hypothetical three
monitoring policies yield 8 PASS / 1 UNKNOWN, leaving product acceptance UNKNOWN. Phase 1 remains
**CURRENT/PARTIAL — FRESHNESS_POLICY_PENDING**. Next: accountable owner decision,
then separately authorized controlled activation; condition policies need further
engineering evidence. BFPT frozen/KKS issue unchanged. Earlier sections are
historical checkpoints, not current policy activation instructions.

## Latest runtime promotion — NADI-IDN-002B-R1-FIX-01 (8 October 2026)

**PASS — bounded first real Coal Flow A evidence pilot.** PR22 MERGED;
authoritative source `478cce1958ab5800ce21d7b1e93b83ff43c1ac19` deployed to
Cockpit API/operator tooling only. No application repair or unmerged code was
needed. Existing control checkout, private configuration and all accepted
worker/PI/web/DB images remain preserved. Image ID plus serving-source checksum
prove the reviewed 512-character contract; actual 203 and synthetic 512 accepted,
513 rejected. Historical Compose revision label is not the image source SHA.

Fauzi's existing 2026-10-08 approval for precisely Coal Flow A / `coal_flow`
is now persisted through canonical administration. Exactly one approved signal,
one latest condition evidence and one projection state; VERIFIED mapping 1 /
PROPOSED 0 unchanged. No new identity review or approval was requested.
Five guarded current-source GETs (six cumulative including R1 identity GET)
produced NUMERIC evidence with original `Ton/h`, time/quality/lineage; four
canonical schema/model checks passed. Real replay writes 0 and preserves every
condition row, source/projection timestamp, state and API document.

[Operational evidence](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-idn-002b-coal-feeder-a.md#r1-fix-01--reviewed-runtime-promotion-and-first-real-evidence)
records backup, immutable image, counts, actual response, replay, API/UI and
all nine gates. Coverage 845 registered / 1 VERIFIED / 1 approved-signal asset /
1 projected asset. Source policy remains blank; Good is signal quality only.
Actual readiness: governance/schema/identity/selection/status PASS; three
collector/Mart freshness gates UNKNOWN; projection gate UNKNOWN due
UNKNOWN_SOURCE_OR_PROJECTION_FRESHNESS. Overall UNKNOWN, require-pass exit 2.
The measured real projection is accepted; freshness-qualified readiness is not.

**PHASE 1 SOFTWARE RUNTIME FOUNDATION: ACCEPTED.**
**BOUNDED REAL PILOT: ACCEPTED.**
**PHASE 1 PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE: NOT PASS — FRESHNESS_POLICY_PENDING.**
Phase 1 remains CURRENT/PARTIAL. Identity approval, signal approval, bounded
canary, controlled handoff and real replay are complete for this one asset only.
Other equipment identities remain unverified. The live technical inventory
remains 433 active; technical BAD_QUALITY 18 and epoch timestamps are independent
of this Good pilot evidence. PI_AF_KKS_LOOKUP_UNRESOLVED remains open;
BFPT stays REJECTED/FROZEN/DO NOT VERIFY.

Task-attributable mutations: one signal selection and one evidence/state batch;
replay 0 writes, mapping mutations 0, source writes 0. Collector/web restarts,
DDL/history/discovery/registry/reset/volume recreation/new operational DB,
CEMS/NK changes and credential exposure 0. Only cockpit-api replaced once;
22 other existing container identities remain unchanged. No recurring condition
projection was enabled. No unnecessary repair PR; documentation checkpoint
is separate from deployed source. Earlier checkpoints below are historical.

Next: approve defensible collector/source/projection freshness policies and
controlled refresh/acceptance procedure, then rerun actual readiness without
weakening gates. No new mapping, broader signal selection or health scoring
is implied by this successful one-signal pilot.

## Historical R1 checkpoint — signal approved, runtime contract repair pending (8 October 2026)

**PARTIAL — CODE_ACCEPTANCE_REQUIRED.** Fauzi directly approved exactly one
Coal Flow A / `coal_flow` signal on 2026-10-08, evidence reference
`NADI-SIGNAL-COAL-FLOW-A-20261008`. Human signal approval is now RECEIVED.
One exact guarded Attribute metadata GET proved ownership by the existing
VERIFIED Coal Feeder A AF Element. NUMERIC and local source unit `Ton/h` are
preserved; no unit conversion, engineering SLA or Hidayat signal approval is claimed.

Canonical production approval failed before DML: the exact Attribute WebId has
203 characters, exceeding the merged contract's 200-character limit. PR22
contains an additive, bounded 512-character Attribute-reference correction,
consistent Python/JSON contracts and synthetic SQLite/PostgreSQL/API acceptance.
No candidate application code was deployed. This is a concrete independent
SOFTWARE/RUNTIME blocker for this pilot; historical foundation acceptance below
remains evidence of its earlier bounded validation.

Production remains PROPOSED=0 / VERIFIED=1, selected signals=0, condition
latest/state=0/0. Source canary/handoff/projection/replay NOT RUN. R1 PI source
GET=1 (identity metadata), Maximo GET=0; business writes/mapping mutation/
signal persistence/projection/deployment/restart/DDL=0. Blank freshness policies
remain UNKNOWN / FRESHNESS_POLICY_PENDING. Identity gate PASS for this pilot,
signal/projection BLOCKED NO_APPROVED_SIGNALS; overall readiness BLOCKED.
**PHASE 1 PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE: BLOCKED; Phase 1 CURRENT/PARTIAL.**

[Full R1 evidence and test commands](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-idn-002b-coal-feeder-a.md#r1--explicit-coal-flow-a-signal-approval-8-october-2026)
records 440 distinct Cockpit/PI/contracts test cases passing across isolated
fixtures and opt-in environments. Accepted runtime, 433 active PI attributes,
Maximo recovery floor and SELECT-only reader are preserved.
PI_AF_KKS_LOOKUP_UNRESOLVED stays open; BFPT REJECTED/FROZEN/DO NOT VERIFY.

Next: review/merge PR22's compatible contract repair, deliberately deploy reviewed
compatible consumer/operator tooling with accepted overrides, then resume the
already authorized one-signal approval → bounded governed canary → schema-valid
handoff → Mart projection/replay → API/UI/readiness. No repeat human approval is
required for the recorded scope. Approve freshness policy separately before
claiming final Phase-1 PASS. Earlier checkpoints below are historical.

## Historical pilot checkpoint — NADI-IDN-002B (8 October 2026)

[Coal Feeder A evidence](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-idn-002b-coal-feeder-a.md)
records **PARTIAL**: one BSR/IP CS01 Coal Feeder A mapping is VERIFIED via
canonical dry-run → PROPOSED → explicit human-review transition.
`verified_by=Fauzi`; technical reviewer Hidayat, System Owner Boiler / Senior
Engineer, in-person verbal MATCH reported by operator on 2026-10-08.
No signed artifact or direct engineer authentication is claimed.
Production PROPOSED=0 / VERIFIED=1, ambiguity=0, approved signals=0, condition evidence=0.
**SIGNAL_APPROVAL_PENDING**: exact local Coal Flow A reference identified,
accountable meaning/use approval pending; canary/projection not run, source GET=0.
Identity gate PASS for this pilot; signal/projection BLOCKED NO_APPROVED_SIGNALS.
Maximo/Mart/PI freshness UNKNOWN with blank policy; governance/schema/status PASS.
**PHASE 1 PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE: BLOCKED**, Phase 1 CURRENT/PARTIAL.
HUMAN_CROSSWALK_REQUIRED is resolved for this one asset only; other identities
remain unverified. PI_AF_KKS_LOOKUP_UNRESOLVED is separate and unchanged;
BFPT REJECTED/FROZEN/DO NOT VERIFY. No runtime redeploy/DDL or source changes.
Next: one accountable signal approval → bounded governed canary → accepted
handoff/idempotent projection, plus approved freshness policy and actual readiness.
Older checkpoint populations below are historical as of their respective audits.

## Current Phase-1 runtime acceptance — 2026-10-08

PR20 MERGED; exact main `c2fb0fc686396e79c19f42af46694673827493a9` deployed
for PI API, NADI API and UI. Existing control checkout/accepted overrides,
workers, projector and DB volumes remain preserved. See
[operational acceptance](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-phase1-runtime-acceptance-001.md)
and [authoritative Phase-1 matrix](NADI-PHASE-1-ACCEPTANCE.md).

**PHASE 1 SOFTWARE RUNTIME FOUNDATION: ACCEPTED.**
**PHASE 1 PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE: BLOCKED.** Phase 1 stays **CURRENT / PARTIAL**.
Existing Mart canonical002/003/004 ready; validated private full backup and
17 locked factual count/content comparisons passed. The dedicated Mart reader remains
SELECT-only, including three empty condition relations. PI local stored-data
observation and NADI integration-status/Data Trust/Asset condition panels live.
Readiness: governance/condition-schema/status PASS; collection/projection freshness
UNKNOWN because **FRESHNESS_POLICY_PENDING**; identity/selection/projection BLOCKED
with **HUMAN_CROSSWALK_REQUIRED**. Registry845, PI active433, mapping0/0,
approved signals0 and projected evidence0. Technical BAD_QUALITY18 remains visible;
a complete collector cycle does not prove source freshness or equipment health.

NADI-IDN-002 human crosswalk remains BLOCKED / EXTERNAL; BFPT remains
REJECTED / FROZEN / DO NOT VERIFY. Runtime is ready for NADI-IDN-002B **when a
controlled human MATCH becomes available**, then attributable human verification
and separately authorized bounded governed canary. Approved signal semantics,
engineering freshness/quality policy and real bounded projection remain subsequent
product prerequisites. No production source GET/mapping/signal/projection was
initiated by runtime acceptance. Documentation/evidence PR remains OPEN/UNMERGED.

GitHub already marked PR19 MERGED separately; this differs from expected
superseded/unmerged metadata. Its211faec commit is already an ancestor of required
main; executor merged neither PR and did not deploy PR19 separately.
Older checkpoints below preserve historical evidence and do not override this state.

`f8c37f068102a06906cb3ca464fe08745e0351cf`. PR #19 remains OPEN/UNMERGED and its
branch is untouched. The new bundle includes that foundation and supersedes
PR #19 **only if the bundle is accepted**. Neither PR is automatically merged.

[Authoritative Phase-1 acceptance](NADI-PHASE-1-ACCEPTANCE.md) distinguishes
candidate software tests from operational deployment and human/data acceptance.
B0 freshness wiring, B1 integration status/Data Trust, B2 synthetic PostgreSQL
projection acceptance and B3 read-only Phase-1 preflight are implemented candidates.
NADI-IDN-002 human crosswalk remains BLOCKED / EXTERNAL; verification PENDING.
Production PROPOSED0 / VERIFIED0 remain unchanged; BFPT stays REJECTED / FROZEN.

**PHASE 1 SOFTWARE READINESS: PASS (candidate, bounded bundle scope)**
**PHASE 1 PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE: BLOCKED**
External identity blocker: **HUMAN_CROSSWALK_REQUIRED**. It is not the only
outstanding product prerequisite: reviewed runtime deployment, existing-Mart
condition migration 004/reader grants, explicit freshness policy, approved pilot
signals and real governed evidence acceptance are still required. No operational
condition migration or projection was performed. Phase 1 remains CURRENT / PARTIAL.
Next: senior bundle review; separately authorized runtime acceptance can proceed
independently of human crosswalk. With controlled MATCH evidence, execute
NADI-IDN-002B human verification/governed canary, then approved bounded projection.

## Historical NADI-ING-PI-001A checkpoint — 2026-10-07

PR #18 MERGED; baseline origin/main `f8c37f068102a06906cb3ca464fe08745e0351cf`.
[NADI-ING-PI-001A](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-ing-pi-001a.md) implementation
**CURRENT / candidate**, synthetic acceptance **PASS**: explicit separately
approved selected signals, governed collector boundary, canonical typed evidence,
additive latest-only existing-Mart migration, read-only API/Asset view and four
independent freshness dimensions. No production deployment/projection is claimed.

NADI-PI-001 ✅ MERGED; NADI-PI-RUNTIME-001 ✅ ACCEPTED;
NADI-RUNTIME-002 ✅ ACCEPTED. NADI-IDN-002A R1/R2 evidence rounds are completed;
NADI-IDN-002 human crosswalk **BLOCKED / EXTERNAL**, human verification PENDING.
PROPOSED0 / VERIFIED0 remain unchanged. BFPT stays REJECTED / FROZEN.
Task source GET/write0, no operational DDL/restart/new DB. Phase 1 remains
**CURRENT / PARTIAL**. Next: **NADI-INTEGRATION-STATUS-001**. Real governed PI
projection still requires human identity plus signal approval and deployment review.

Audit date: **2026-10-07**. This is the Git-backed repository snapshot, not a
fresh production-runtime audit. Read [roadmap index](README.md) for priorities.

[NADI-IDN-002A packet](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-idn-002-pilot.md) records
20 shortlisted assets, 4 researched pairs, 18 bounded read-only PI GETs. One

PR #15 MERGED at 12:45:45 UTC; baseline `origin/main`
`c052d7d7d007c2a670300d0eb9d08dda8d93f473`. Fresh `codex/nadi-runtime-002`

Existing collector-owned Mart now has canonical governance 002/003,
empty asset_af_mapping, checksummed ledger and dedicated SELECT-only NADI reader.
All 17 existing table counts/content fingerprints preserved during DDL. Only API
replaced; accepted Maximo/PI/CEMS/projector/volumes remain unchanged. Managed and
external DSNs are explicit with no legacy fallback; new schema gate is local-only.
[Acceptance evidence](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-runtime-002.md).
READY — NADI-IDN-002, without executing real pilot mapping. Review PR stays
OPEN/UNMERGED; Phase 1 stays CURRENT / PARTIAL. Older sections below are dated
historical checkpoints; their absent-schema/open-PR claims are not current state.

## Historical NADI-PI-RUNTIME-001 checkpoint — 2026-10-07

Latest verified baseline `origin/main`: `3e981a3c5e20e148feba5b01ec0b1c134ca89205`.
PR #12 is **MERGED** at 10:27:39 UTC, after PR #13/#14. Its final pre-merge
head was `10f9e4a`; old IMPLEMENTED/MERGE-CANDIDATE statements below are dated
historical checkpoints. Phase 0 factual acceptance stays CURRENT; Phase 1 stays
CURRENT / PARTIAL. See [PI runtime evidence](../pi-collector/docs/nadi-pi-runtime-001.md).

Runtime control remains the original feature checkout `0c800da`, not the fresh
`codex/nadi-pi-runtime-001` review branch. PI API/source code was built from exact
merged `3e981a3`; private operator/lease modules are the runtime PR's new scope.
Migration 004 is applied to the same existing PI DB. One known source GET passed
and one snapshot owner is enabled; no governed NADI signal/projection is claimed.
Actual Mart owner is existing Maximo DB; `asset_af_mapping` is absent there.
[NADI-RUNTIME-002](NADI-RUNTIME-002.md) owns broader Mart runtime/governance schema
reconciliation before the NADI-IDN-002 pilot. Managed Mart DSN and PI opt-in
wiring corrections are proposed here; external-mode/full-platform acceptance is
not certified. NK and the mixed historical feature commit remain outside scope.

## Historical NADI-PI-001-FIX-01 reconciliation — 2026-10-07

Latest fetched `origin/main`: `52c67d41115b324e57c93bf82264a38951a6c275`.
PR #14 merged at 2026-10-07T10:09:16Z, after PR #13. Existing PR #12 previous
HEAD: `417dbc8316e1bfbd9ffba0c8bd4777bd186cf8ff`; a normal merge incorporates
main with no conflicts or published-history rewrite. Maximo implementation and
[WO acceptance evidence](../maximo-collector/docs/maximo-wo-recency-002.md) are
preserved unchanged. Maximo WO and NADI registered BSR/IP are CURRENT within
the accepted population; Phase 1 and MXR-004 remain CURRENT/PARTIAL and PARTIAL.
NADI-PI-001 stays IMPLEMENTED / MERGE-CANDIDATE on open, unmerged PR #12.

Final PI sequence: 001_init, 002_collect_runs, 003_backfill_progress,
004_signal_quality_fields. Duplicate numeric-prefix regression is added.
Migration 004 remains nullable/additive/guarded, prepared but not applied;
production PI access, pilot mappings and NADI PI projection are outside FIX-01.
See [offline evidence](../pi-collector/docs/nadi-pi-001-implementation.md#fix-01-reconciliation-and-migration-sequence).

## Historical NADI-PI-001 update — 2026-10-07

Verified new implementation baseline: `origin/main`
`a8393ba7d8dfddcae67b14b6153a8056c2f01d34`, which includes PLATFORM-ROADMAP-001.
`codex/nadi-pi-001-governed-source-adapter` selectively adapts `d23f848` with
additional lineage checks, streaming limits, typed JSON value evidence and
hermetic persistence/API tests. **IMPLEMENTED / MERGE-CANDIDATE**, not merged
or deployed. The quality migration is now numbered 004 after FIX-01, prepared
but not applied. Production PI requests: 0.
NK/deployment/CEMS are untouched; Phase 1 remains CURRENT / PARTIAL.
See [implementation evidence](../pi-collector/docs/nadi-pi-001-implementation.md).
Next: runtime/Mart reconciliation if needed, then NADI-IDN-002 pilot.

The remaining baseline/branch tables below preserve the PLATFORM-ROADMAP-001
dated audit; their ahead/behind counts are historical, not recomputed here.

## Baseline and method

| Fact | Verified result |
|---|---|
| Repository | `johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter`, public, not archived |
| Default branch | `main` |
| Starting main SHA | `ef07a263b122d30e7dbec451e6094f9016b603c3` |
| Main commit date | `2026-08-24T18:45:41+07:00` |
| Audit branch | `codex/platform-roadmap-realignment`, created directly from fetched `origin/main` in a clean, separate worktree |
| Factual RC tag | `v0.1.0-rc.1` → `af1d9bde22dd37c96ec8156496d209532c0f601a`, reachable from main |
| PRs before this audit PR | #1–#10 MERGED; no OPEN PR returned by complete listing (10 total) |
| Main protection | `protected: false` from GitHub branches API; settings unchanged |
| Tracked GitHub workflow config | No `.github/` files in audited main tree; this is not evidence about every external CI service |
| Feature branch | `feature/pi-governed-source-adapter`: ahead 2, behind 0 |

Evidence method: fetch remote refs; inspect first-parent and reachability history;
use `rev-list --left-right --count` and `git cherry` to distinguish ancestry from
patch equivalence; read relevant main/branch documents, patches and source;
query GitHub PR/branch metadata. Documentation/status is evaluated against the
main SHA above; branch artifacts remain explicitly UNMERGED.

Codebase-memory Tier 2 and the existing graphify graph supplied structural
pointers. The code graph generation was `2026-08-24T09:24:57Z`, rooted in the
original checkout, not this main worktree. Coverage reported stale/untracked
NK, PI boundary and some governance files; deployment docs are excluded. Exact
Git blobs/main source were used for these claims, rather than assuming graph
completeness. This is a bounded roadmap audit, not an exhaustive code/security
or live source audit.

The original feature checkout retains a local production export; it was not
copied into this clean worktree or published. No historical branch, feature
code, binary or dataset was merged/copied in this task.

## Merged evidence catalog

| Scope | Integration evidence | Authoritative detailed evidence |
|---|---|---|

| SQLite mapping timestamp correction | [PR #10](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/10), `ef07a26` | Main baseline includes the correction; test artifact does not certify active DB migration |

PR merge SHAs differ from branch heads because integration used merge commits.
Every listed integration SHA and tag is reachable from audited main. Source
knowledge can be newer than the accepted canonical/product projection; keep
both boundaries explicit until a reviewed implementation changes them.

## Documentation reconciliation

| Artifact | Classification / decision |
|---|---|
| Root README | Old “templates only” claim and missing CEMS were STALE; rewritten as CURRENT platform entry point |
| Root AGENTS | Old seven-project/no-root-runtime/only-application framing was PARTIAL; rewritten for platform ownership, evidence and no-new-DB rules, with NK marked UNMERGED |
| `plans/README.md` and new vision/product/status docs | CURRENT entry point; one owner document per status dimension |
| `plans/reliability-cockpit-platform/05-roadmap-implementasi.md` | CURRENT engineering backlog with reconciled M0–M8 status; 20-Aug execution table retained as HISTORICAL |
| Older planning docs 01–04/06 and plan-folder introduction | PARTIAL / HISTORICAL assumptions; preserved with a supersession notice, not execution authority for current product status |
| “Cockpit never reads collector SQL” in old plan | SUPERSEDED for the explicit SELECT-only canonical Mart path; legacy API ingestion remains correct |
| Domain semantics, contract, Mart and source discovery docs | CURRENT within their dated/accepted scope; semantic unknowns remain binding, not globally solved by a discovery PR |
| Factual V1 RC/readiness notes | HISTORICAL QA plus CURRENT factual product boundary; stale PR/tag pending state reconciled to PR #1/tag |
| `summary.md` | HISTORICAL; its “collector-only cockpit refactor not started” statement is superseded by main |
| `CODEX_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` | Old discovery-first task was STALE as a general onboarding default; replaced with roadmap-aware instructions |
| `USERGUIDE.md` | HISTORICAL standalone setup guide; preserved with a deployment/ownership notice |
| `deploy/compose/README.md` | PARTIAL runtime runbook; corrected API-only statement and warns that main lacks Mart DSN wiring and managed PI worker |
| Feature-only AGENTS / NK / governed PI docs | UNMERGED evidence only; not used to claim main has those services or files |

## Debt inventory and dispositions

| Debt | State | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| D01 Governed PI adapter | MERGED / runtime checkpoint above | NADI-PI-001 selectively adapts `d23f848` from `main a8393ba`, reconciled with `main 52c67d4` via FIX-01; PR #12 merged, migration 004 applied by NADI-PI-RUNTIME-001; governed pilot/projection remain pending |
| D02 Mixed platform/NK feature commit | UNMERGED / NEEDS_REVIEW | Split/review NK, deployment, documentation and data/model publication from `0c800da`; do not bulk merge for PI integration |
| D03 Mart runtime DSN | UNMERGED / PARTIAL | Review `7149455`: main Compose lacks `RELIABILITY_MART_DATABASE_URL`; retain external-mode wiring, init dependency and regression intent after reconciling managed-mode overlap in `0c800da` |
| D04 Home Asset Health access note | UNMERGED / HISTORICAL | Compare `94721eb` with merged MX-013A/B. It records TLS-blocked access, not verified Wellness/ACR/MPI; preserve useful network evidence later without reopening this audit's source access |
| D05 Source→product semantic adoption | PARTIAL | FMEA item fields/RCFA source Asset relationships/Overhaul additions are discovery findings, not already accepted canonical UI joins or KPI semantics |
| D06 Pilot identity and runtime migration | NEEDS_REVIEW | Mapping administration is merged, but no production mapping seed or migration execution is certified by Git; approve scoped pilot and read-only-role/runtime readiness separately |
| D07 Collection/integration acceptance | PARTIAL | Validate capacity, single-worker ownership, freshness/coverage/degraded states and 24–72h/backup restore acceptance in authorized later tasks |
| D08 Governance / CI | NEEDS_REVIEW | Main is unprotected and tracked GitHub workflow config absent; adopt lightweight PR and relevant checks, protection separately if authorized |
| D09 Runtime vs Git handoff | NEEDS_REVIEW | Feature deployment reports restored local data and PI HTTP 401; these are dated operational handoffs, not main runtime guarantees. User deferred credential checking; do not retry here |

### Required branch details

Counts are **ahead / behind audited main**, not “number of changes to merge”.
A diverged branch has both counts > 0. `git cherry` found no patch-equivalent
unique commits for the three branches below with positive ahead counts.

| Branch | Head SHA | Ahead / behind | Unique work | Disposition |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `feature/pi-governed-source-adapter` | `0c800dac1da6ef863afdb193021176fe7feac073` | 2 / 0 | `d23f84851716cec88e43237654a1c58fa79e63d4` governed PI source boundary; `0c800da` adds NK and managed runtime/docs | KEEP TEMPORARILY / UNMERGED; review and split by concern |
| `fix/nadi-mart-runtime-wiring` | `71494550714f77af8f9cb68c90722732e18b5ca8` | 1 / 20, diverged | Mart DSN template, managed/external Compose wiring, init dependency and regression tests | CHERRY-PICK CANDIDATE after adaptation; not safe to assume superseded completely |
| `discovery/mx-013h-home-asset-health-source` | `94721eb0b54c70bef21e5604e0a9f41168943544` | 1 / 20, diverged | One documentation commit: home TLS blocked before auth/business discovery; no new source meaning | NEEDS_REVIEW; retain historically useful bounded access evidence |
| `fix/unblock-local-collector-access` | `88f573e781bf4ea0a1cc3ee14cce2bb8d5c58f31` | 0 / 78 | None outside main; ancestor | MERGED/HISTORICAL; deletion candidate only after owner review |
| `task/nadi-002-asset-reliability-workspace` | `449ca5cfcf4c41525bd3a958e28b3f2fa54312ca` | 0 / 21 | None outside main; factual RC integrated via PR #1 | MERGED/HISTORICAL; preserve PR/tag before any later cleanup |

`7149455` adds external Mart configuration that `0c800da` does not include;
the latter hardcodes a managed DSN and adds other services. Review both targets
and tests rather than declaring the old fix obsolete. No cherry-pick, merge,
branch deletion, or protection change was performed by this task.

### Remaining remote branch inventory

All remote branch heads were examined, not only the five required names.
Main is the baseline; the current audit branch is omitted from this pre-PR
inventory. Rows with ahead 0 are reachable from main and have no unique commits;
“historical” does not automatically authorize deleting them.

Two additional local-only historical branches were checked:

| Local-only branch | Full head SHA | Ahead / behind | Result |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `task/mx-006r-targeted-live-verification` | `49651cc2b9223e85da1e7f489ff9fbe7a3dc72e5` | 0 / 72 | Ancestor of main; no unique work |

Two local heads differ from remote, but are also ancestors of main with no
unique work:

| Local branch | Local head SHA | Ahead / behind main | Remote distinction |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `fix/unblock-local-collector-access` | `f85dfa6c07f4d278424ac7d9e16b72682332f6c6` | 0 / 74 | Remote head is `88f573e`; local advanced further in already-integrated history |
| `task/mx-008s-live-canonical-smoke` | `6ec2b228fc96b012965570690fbc910989b42ad3` | 0 / 56 | Remote head is `92984b7`; local includes the already-integrated Mart schema commit |

All remaining pre-existing local heads with remote counterparts matched them
at audit. The audit worktree was clean before edits. The original feature
checkout's untracked report is not a reason to reset that checkout or copy it
into documentation.

## Lightweight repository governance

```text
main ← reviewed Pull Request ← one task branch
```

Prefer `codex/<task>` for agent-created branches; existing `task/*`, `feature/*`,
`fix/*` and `discovery/*` remain valid historical conventions. One concern per
PR, task ID and scope in the body, acceptance evidence, migration/rollback
notes only where relevant. For a solo maintainer, self-review plus relevant
checks is sufficient to keep velocity; request a second review for identity,
source safety, scoring, production migration or write-back decisions.

Recommended later protection: require PRs, block force-push/deletion of main,
and require the relevant automated checks after those checks exist. One review
can be required when a reviewer is available; avoid permanently blocking a
solo maintainer on an unavailable reviewer. `protected: false` is an observation,
not an authorization to change settings in this task.

Use documentation/link/diff checks for docs PRs and each owning component's
hermetic/contract tests for code changes. No workflow files are added here.
After integration, update the owning roadmap status with accepted evidence;
Git reachability and PR state outrank dated proposal checklists.

## Documentation validation

PLATFORM-ROADMAP-001 checks before PR creation:

- `git diff --cached --check`: PASS.
- Staged diff gate: 19 changed files, all `.md`; no application code, Compose,
  migration, data, image, model, or other binary changes.
- Local Markdown targets/heading anchors: 94 checked, zero errors; branch-only
  GitHub blob references validated against local Git objects. General external
  web links were not crawled; PR/commit/tag evidence came from GitHub/Git.
- 56 commit references resolved; mainline evidence ancestry and the five
  required remote branch refs verified.
- All 78 detailed engineering backlog IDs and the old historical status table
  preserved; current M0–M8 status is separately reconciled.
- Added-line secret-pattern scan: no private keys, credential URLs, GitHub
  tokens or AWS keys found. No environment file or raw report copied.
- `git ls-remote --tags` confirms the RC tag on GitHub and its peeled mainline
  commit. PR listing and branch-protection reads were read-only.

The temporary local documentation validator was used because no tracked
Markdown validator/workflow was identified in the audited baseline. Application
suites and production smoke were not rerun for this Markdown-only change.

## Review notes and audit limits

- Phase 0 COMPLETE refers to the accepted factual RC boundary, not all M0–M8
  exit criteria or continuously healthy source integrations.
- All M0–M8 remain PARTIAL at full-milestone scope where wider acceptance is
  unproven; detailed completed artifacts remain credited.
- NK manual baseline is implemented only on feature; automatic acceptance is
  not inferred from tests/model files, and UI accuracy/uncertainty claims need
  separate validation. No artifact is moved out of the monorepo.
- Source credentials and live pilot readiness were not checked. PI HTTP 401 is
  a previous handoff and remains deferred; no new source requests were made.
- Branch cleanup and runtime fixes are recommendations for later PRs. This PR
  changes only Markdown and leaves application/runtime files identical to main.

## Freshness governance proposal checkpoint — NADI-P1-FRESH-001A (8 October 2026)

Reviewed main `478cce1` is serving. Runtime evidence reconciliation is the separate
[documentation PR23](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/23),
head `b08a4fd`; review that documentation checkpoint first. The earlier R1 repair
blocker is historical: one VERIFIED mapping, one approved Coal Flow signal and
one accepted condition row now exist. This proposal does not duplicate that
acceptance patch or alter its measurement.

[Freshness engineering proposal](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-phase1-freshness-policy-proposal.md)
records bounded local cadence/error evidence and proposes separate acquisition
monitoring boundaries. All proposals are **PROPOSED — NOT YET APPROVED**. Coal
Flow source/projection thresholds remain **POLICY_EVIDENCE_INSUFFICIENT**. Three
shared runtime knobs cannot express five independent policies; reviewed compatible
component wiring and controlled-refresh journal/chronology acceptance are next.
Production policies remain blank, handoff collector success remains null, actual
Phase1 readiness remains UNKNOWN; Phase1 stays CURRENT/PARTIAL, never COMPLETE.
No source GET, mapping/selection mutation, projection, deployment or restart
is performed by this task. Next: **NADI-P1-FRESH-001B**, engineering policy
decisions and separately authorized manual refresh; recurring scheduling stays
unconfigured. PI_AF_KKS_LOOKUP_UNRESOLVED and BFPT freeze remain in force.

## Component freshness implementation candidate — NADI-P1-FRESH-001B

PR #23/PR #24 are merged; base `4b6ae7d`. [Implementation and deployment runbook](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-p1-freshness-implementation.md) adds five independent
blank-default policies with exclusive legacy compatibility, API-only runtime
wiring and a manually invoked one-asset/one-signal refresh coordinator. Private
journal, shared host lock, existing-Mart advisory lease, Collector-owned five-GET
cap, chronology/quality gates and read-only replay are implemented in the candidate.
No candidate code is deployed, no policy is activated and no production refresh
or mapping/selection mutation occurs. Runtime remains `478cce1`; Phase 1 remains
CURRENT/PARTIAL and actual readiness UNKNOWN. Threshold 660/660/1800 proposals,
source/projection policies and one live run require separate accountable approval
after software review/merge. Next: exact merged-SHA controlled deployment,
configuration preflight and separately authorized single manual Coal Flow refresh
plus real replay/API/UI/readiness acceptance. No recurring scheduler is enabled.
PI_AF_KKS_LOOKUP_UNRESOLVED and BFPT freeze remain unchanged.

## Engineering advisory candidate — verified 2026-10-11

Main baseline remains `cc90fc73bea6ae399383d8538035c6454dc7e65a`.
[PR #68](https://github.com/johnd-creator/reliability-knowledge-starter/pull/68),
`codex/nadi-eng-bundle-a`, is an unmerged Engineering QA candidate. It adds
structured Case UX, existing Recommendation/Action Board controls and disposable-
QA-proven Advisory/Inbox contracts. Overall delivery PARTIAL: persistent advisory
schema change was denied by automatic approval review under this task's
migration restriction. No persistent DDL occurred; those APIs/UI writes are gated.

Tests, responsive evidence, preservation and exact-source rollback are recorded in
[the Engineering report](../reliability-cockpit/docs/nadi-eng-bundle-a.md).
PR #67 remains OPEN/independent; no production or source activation, engineering
UAT, PO acceptance or operational delivery is claimed. The single frontend remains
HTTPS 3000 under the existing launcher. All collectors, operational APIs/stores,
original PNGs and workbook are preserved. Phase 2/4 remain PARTIAL.
